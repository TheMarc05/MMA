        <h1>About MusicStyle</h1>
        <p>
          We don't just sell clothes. We sell a statementâ€”crafted for the sound
          you live by.
        </p>
        <p>
          At <strong> MusicStyle</strong>, fashion meets frequency. Whether
          you're vibing to lo-fi chill, headbanging to metal, or raving in EDM,
          we design collections that sync with your soundtrack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Born from the belief that music and style go hand in hand, our brand
          lets you wear your playlistâ€”loud and proud.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every piece is inspired by a genre, designed for self-expression, and
          created for those who let rhythm rule their world.
        </p>
        <p>ðŸ–¤ Wear what you feel. ðŸŽµ Be who you are.</p>
